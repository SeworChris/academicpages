I am a doctoral candidate in the Environmental Health (Epidemiology Specialization) program at <a href="https://www.colostate.edu" target="_blank"> Colorado State University (CSU)</a>. My research focuses on understanding how environmental exposures, particularly air pollution, affect non-communicable disease risk amongst vulnerable populations. By leveraging data from interventional and cross-sectional studies, I explore the impact of household air pollution, on inflammation and adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes. I am also interested in exploring the role of effect modifiers such as diet and physical activity in the relationship between household air pollution and these health outcomes. 

I received my Master of Public Health degree at <a href="https://www.cukerala.ac.in/" target="_blank"> the Central University of Kerala (CUK)</a>, India through the prestigious African Scholarship Scheme under the Indian Council for Cultural Relations. In my master's dissertation, by leveraging large-scale cross-sectional data from the Demographic and Health (DHS)  and Multiple Indicators (MICS) surveys, I explored the trend of the risk estimates of determinants of child malnutrition in Ghana between 2003 and 2017. My undergraduate degree, which was obtained from <a href="https://ucc.edu.gh/" target="_blank"> the University of Cape Coast (UCC)</a>, Ghana was in Biomedical Sciences.

Outside of studies, I enjoy spending time with my family, listening to music and audiobooks, and engaging in conversation between the intersection of faith and science.
